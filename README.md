This game plots colored dots on a grid and the player must connect the dots with matching colors, filling the grid and without overlapping the lines. The code will plot a random point and find a reachable spot for the corresponding other point using a modified BFS. Depending on the length of some paths, the puzzle will push or pull dots to fill the grid.
